### Project Highlights
One feature that stands out is the use of Angular Signals for state management. I never had an opportunity to, to play around with Signals like that - so I decided to do it now. For better or worse. :D

### What I'm Most Pleased or Proud Of
I tried to use all new bells and whistles from Angular 18. I added Nx to scaffold everything easily and have apps/libs separation but it backfired and made me stuck on broken config for a long time. First time ever I had an issue with Nx foundation - which was an interesting investigation. eslintrc.json was never generated in root and Nx wasn't going to easily tell me about it. 

### Future Improvements
With more time, I would focus on implementing lazy loading and deferred content rendering using Angular's @defer. Maybe some unit tests with a solid foundation. I would spend more time on breaking things down to smaller components with onPush and maybe even go zonless for fun.
